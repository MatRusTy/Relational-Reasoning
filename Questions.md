# Questions

- do we need to ever write rho(e) and e[typ/X], given that there are no types in our expressions?
    - Otherwise, how do I get through Tlam and Tapp cases?

- Is my value interpretation for function type correct?

- Cng-rec
    - How do we use the initial assumption?
        - How do we instantiate it?

- Cng-Tlam
    - Should I prove well-typedness in this case. It seems relevant.
