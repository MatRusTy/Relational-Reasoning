- What should introduction and conclusion entail?
  introduction: motivate
      program equivalence
      contextual equivalence is one notion of this. informal definition
      Then talk about the language and some of its features. We shall then talk about
      contextual equivalence in this language and see some interesting examples.
      Turns out we will need logical relations...

- getting more space
  - move evaluation under context proof to appendix
    - remove corollary from EuC together with proof
  - move proof of Identity: Contextual equivalence to appendix.
    - most of it is unfolding definitions and applying fundamental theorem, and in the end using identity: reduction and determinacy
  - Merge chapter 6 and 7. conclusion and ideas for future work.

by the end of next week.
