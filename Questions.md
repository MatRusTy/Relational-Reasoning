- What should introduction and conclusion entail?
    introduction: motivate
        program equivalence
        contextual equivalence is one notion of this. informal definition
        Then talk about the language and some of its features. We shall then talk about
        contextual equivalence in this language and see some interesting examples.
        Turns out we will need logical relations...


- LR model, LR, logical relation. Correct terminology.
  - Does it make sense to say that the LR model consists of value interpretation, expression interpretation, variable env interpretation, type env interpretation and the final LR predicate (xi, gamma |- e LR e' : t)?
  - Does it make sense to refer to the relation defined by the last predicate as LR?

The lr model is only the last part
we separate it into smaller points... value interpretations, expression interpretations and so on...
we gradually work towards the complete lr model. split it up into several steps,
where each step increases generality. first values, then closed expr, then general expr.


- getting more space
  - move evaluation under context proof to appendix
    - remove corollary from EuC together with proof
  - move proof of Identity: Contextual equivalence to appendix.
    - most of it is unfolding definitions and applying fundamental theorem, and in the end using identity: reduction and determinacy
  - Merge chapter 6 and 7. conclusion and ideas for future work.

- is my section on definition of LR (4.2) ok?


send report in after rewriting section 4.2
by the end of next week.
