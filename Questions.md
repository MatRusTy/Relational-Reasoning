# Questions

- lam hoisting
  - well-typedness is non-trivial in some places... ignore or?
show lemmas (google photo)
then typing should be provable (check)
or maybe try build around it using assumptions.

- in lemma 9 i.h. remove c: (...)?

- normalisation and type-safety.
    - does this mean that all well typed expressions reduce to a value?
    - or is it only normalisation which is required for this?
    - also isn't our language strongly normalising?
