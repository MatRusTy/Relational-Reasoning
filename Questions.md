- Congruence Rule for T-var?
- Congruence Rule for T-rec (and other that use variables like T-match)?
- Name of rules. Is Cgr-... fine?
- Is the proof of reflexivity correct?
- What is the induction hypothesis in proof of lemma (R(..., e, e',...) and C => R(..., C(e), C(e'))?
- Which compatibility lemmas should i prove?
- Is it correct that, after proving compatibility lemmas and adequacy of LR, then fundamental theorem follows from proof of reflexivity of R?
  - it follows fairly quickly by direct proof; each compatibility lemma corresponds to one case in the induction proof
  - but do we not also just get it from R is reflexive lemma?
