- What is the induction hypothesis in proof of lemma (R(..., e, e',...) and C => R(..., C(e), C(e'), ...)?
    forall the normal lemma. in other words
        forall xi, gamma, xi', gamma', e, e', tau, tau'. ... and C': ... => ... C'[e], C'[e]...
        (type of C' in I.H. unchanged... since it is forall quantified. In other words, only C changes to C')
    Reason about the type of C and C' in each case

- Is it correct that, after proving compatibility lemmas and adequacy of LR, then fundamental theorem follows from proof of reflexivity of R?
  - it follows fairly quickly by direct proof; each compatibility lemma corresponds to one case in the induction proof
  - but do we not also just get it from R is reflexive lemma?
  yes, we get it from R is reflexive lemma.
