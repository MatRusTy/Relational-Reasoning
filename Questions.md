# Questions

- Empty type. What is it? how does it relate to the theorem I have proved?

- Identity. How does this relate to theorems for free?
  - in other words, what is a free theorem?
  - parametricity?

- What should introduction and conclusion entail?
- What should "Comparison to Other Work and Ideas for Future Work" entail?
  - Already have some ideas. Are they good?
  - maybe merge ideas for future work and conclusion?

- LR model, LR, logical relation. Correct terminology.
  - Does it make sense to say that the LR model consists of value interpretation, expression interpretation, variable env interpretation, type env interpretation and the final LR predicate (xi, gamma |- e LR e' : t)?
  - Does it make sense to refer to the relation defined by the last predicate as LR?

- getting more space
  - move evaluation under context proof to appendix
    - remove corollary from EuC together with proof
  - move proof of Identity: Contextual equivalence to appendix.
    - most of it is unfolding definitions and applying fundamental theorem, and in the end using identity: reduction and determinacy
  - Merge chapter 6 and 7. conclusion and ideas for future work.

- is my section on definition of LR (4.2) ok?
