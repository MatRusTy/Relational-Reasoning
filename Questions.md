- lam hoisting
  - which derivation should i use?
  - well-typedness is non-trivial in some places... ignore or?
use top derivation
show lemmas (google photo)
then typing should be provable (check)


- substitution lemma
  - proof is just fundamental theorem?
  - I don't actually need the lemma in the proof of identity function.
    - I get it from an earlier result (when I unfold fundamental theorem on assumption)
yes



- induction on typing derivation in lemma 8 (reflexivity)
  - is the induction hypothesis correct?
in lemma 8 i.h. remove assumption of typing derivation
in lemma 8 i.h. remove c: (...)
